DSA-210 Project
===============

## Motivation

Having an insight into the features affecting rental prices helps renters choose homes more cost-efficiently. By collecting proper and generalized information, I aim to form an analogy between rental prices and the elements that determine them—structural features of the flat, building age, the existence of a middleman, and distance to transportation centers. The main purpose is to help a Sabancı University student find a suitable house in Kurtköy according to their budget by comparing and prioritizing these elements across different websites.

## Research Questions

- How do structural features (apartment size in m², room count, number of bathrooms, floor) influence rent in Kurtköy?
- How does proximity to transportation hubs (metro/bus stops, Sabiha Gökçen Airport) affect rental prices?
- Do newer buildings have a higher price compared to old ones?
- What is the effect of the furnishing on a flat?
- How do listing channels and agents affect the price?

## Dataset

### Time Frame

The dataset will cover the most recent 12 months to reflect current market conditions.

### Primary Data Collection

- Sahibinden.com, Emlakjet, Hepsiemlak for structural rental listings
- Google Maps for computing distances from transportation hubs

### Data Structure

- Collection Date: The date on which the data was collected.
- Listing Date: The date on which the listing was posted.
- Price: The price of the rental house.
- Area (m²): The area of the flat.
- Rooms: The number of rooms.
- Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms.
- Building Age: The age of the building in years.
- Furnishment: Whether the flat is furnished or not.
- Listing Type: Whether the house is rented from the owner or an agency.
- Distance to the nearest metro: Distance to Kurtköy Metro.
- Distance to the nearest bus station: Distance to the nearest bus station.
- Distance to the university: Distance to Sabancı University.
