# Kurtköy Rental Price Analysis - Key Findings

## Project Overview
This is a DSA-210 data science project analyzing rental prices in Kurtköy area to help Sabancı University students find affordable housing.

## Dataset Summary
- **Total Listings Analyzed**: 35 (after cleaning)
  - Sahibinden: 16 listings
  - Hepsiemlak: 12 listings
  - Emlakjet: 19 listings
- **Time Period**: Most recent 12 months

## Key Statistics

### Price Analysis
- **Average Rent**: ₺33,693/month
- **Median Rent**: ₺33,000/month
- **Price Range**: ₺21,000 - ₺52,000
- **Price per m²**: ₺373.31 average

### Property Features
- **Average Area**: 94.1 m²
- **Most Common**: 2+1 apartments (23 out of 35)
- **Average Building Age**: 11.5 years

### Location Factors
- **Distance to Metro**: 0.73 km average (400m - 1.16km)
- **Distance to University**: 7.23 km average
- **Distance to Bus Station**: Data available for some listings

## Correlation Analysis (Impact on Price)

### Positive Correlations (↑ Price increases with):
1. **Area (m²)**: +0.39 - Larger apartments cost more ✓
2. **Bathrooms**: +0.26 - More bathrooms = higher price
3. **Distance to Bus Station**: +0.04 (minimal effect)
4. **Distance to Metro**: +0.04 (minimal effect)

### Negative Correlations (↓ Price decreases with):
1. **Building Age**: -0.14 - Older buildings slightly cheaper
2. **Distance to University**: -0.10 - Farther from university = slightly cheaper

## Key Insights

### 1. **Size Matters Most**
The strongest predictor of rental price is apartment size (m²), with a correlation of 0.39.

### 2. **Proximity Doesn't Matter Much**
Surprisingly, distance to metro, bus station, and university have very weak correlations with price. This suggests that Kurtköy's compact size means location within the area doesn't significantly affect pricing.

### 3. **Building Age Has Limited Impact**
Newer buildings only command a slight premium (-0.14 correlation), suggesting renters prioritize other factors.

### 4. **Agency vs Owner**
Most listings (15 out of 16 identified) are from agencies ("Emlak Ofisinden") rather than direct owners, which may affect prices.

### 5. **Price per m² Varies by Source**
- Emlakjet: ₺401.13/m² (higher-end listings)
- Sahibinden: ₺340.27/m² (more budget-friendly)

## Recommendations for Students

### Budget-Friendly Strategy:
1. **Focus on Size**: Look for smaller apartments (50-80 m²) if on a tight budget
2. **Don't Overpay for Location**: Since distance correlations are weak, you can save money by not prioritizing proximity
3. **Consider Older Buildings**: They're slightly cheaper without major quality differences
4. **Check Sahibinden.com**: Generally shows lower prices per m² than Emlakjet

### Optimal Range for Students:
- **Target Price**: ₺30,000 - ₺35,000/month (median range)
- **Recommended Size**: 80-95 m² (good value)
- **Property Type**: 2+1 apartment (most common and practical)

## Visualizations Generated
1. `analysis_overview.png` - Price distribution, price vs area, price by rooms, price by source
2. `distance_analysis.png` - Distance relationships with price
3. `combined_rental_data.xlsx` - Clean, merged dataset for further analysis

## Next Steps for Further Analysis
1. Collect more data (currently only 35 listings after cleaning)
2. Analyze seasonal price variations
3. Include floor number analysis (if data available)
4. Compare furnished vs unfurnished pricing
5. Add more detailed location analysis (specific neighborhoods)
